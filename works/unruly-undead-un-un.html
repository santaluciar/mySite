The film follows Pietro, a casual player within the video game <i>DayZ</i>, exploring what can be defined as a dreamscape of lush forests against the backdrop of the zombie apocalypse. Wandering, he encounters weird characters who are interrupting each other in a comedy of errors: players gathering to sing a lullaby in the guise of the undead, hard-core survivalists seeking new recruits and a game developer rewriting the very logic of the game world. Following the fairy tale structure of companionship, Santalucia subverts survival gameplay and apocalyptic storytelling into a poetic intervention against the logic of the militarized gaze.

During the collective exhibition <i>Squaring the Circle</i> at <i>V2_Lab for the Unstable Media</i> and <i>Worm Ubik</i>, the film was presented as a single-channel video installation within an environment of light and fabric. By reimagining RGB lighting typically found in gaming setups, the work created an immersive ground-level cinema experience.
