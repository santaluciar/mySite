    Pietro is a casual player within the video game DayZ, exploring a dreamscape of lush forests against the backdrop of the zombie apocalypse. Wandering, he encounters weird characters who are interrupting each other in a comedy of errors: players gathering to sing a lullaby in the guise of the undead, hard-core survivalists seeking new recruits and a game developer rewriting the very logic of the game world. Following the fairy tale structure of companionship, Santalucia subverts survival gameplay and apocalyptic storytelling into a poetic intervention against the logic of the militarized gaze.
