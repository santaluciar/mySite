    Symbol of communal effort and festive release, the pignatta is a colorful vase associated with the celebration of abundance. It is typically filled with treats and is meant to be broken as part of collective celebrations. Found in many cultures worldwive, it can also be found in digital worlds. In gaming, this celebratory symbol transforms in monsters meant to be slain so the hero can seize a precious treasure. Reflecting on his experience of videogaming as an endless repetition of excavating value from the dead bodies of monstrified others, Santalucia devised this animation as a flying camera lingering on the pignatta's fragility. This perspective offers a contemplative space where value arises from attentive observation rather than destruction.

    The film was presented as a looping 2-channel video and 4-channel audio installation within the Reie Festival. It anticipated the audio/visual and dance performance Myein, co-authored with Gloria Dorliguzzo,  further exploring themes of preservation, archival and exploitation through the images of Early Netherlandish Paintings.
