    This animation movie is inspired by a meditation exercise as can be found in the visual primer "Becoming Invisible" by London artist Ian Whittlesea. The book is a guide that draw on the literature of Rosicrucianism, theosophy and esoteric yoga, instructing the reader in the process of splitting light into its constituents parts and interact with them in imaginary ways to achieve a state of invisibility. Santalucia fell asleep several times while trying to achieve this purpose, and woke up not yet invisible, but well rested. Recalling a similar exercise as he experienced it through the guidance of his mother at the age of 11, with the aim of conjuring healing energies, he decided to explore these instructions in the form of an animation accompanied by an original score composed with an accordion and its digital resynthesis. The film ultimately investigates human perception and human emotional responses to light and sound.
