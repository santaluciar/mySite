The film brings together two moments in the daily life of the filmmaker, both occurring in the same year. The first takes place in Sansepolcro (IT), during a residency focused on learning the practice of flag waving. Back then Santalucia received a yellow flag for training purposes, and went into the nearby forests to rehearse, filming his presence in the landscape. Once back in Rotterdam, while engaging in sound walks to discover the urban landscape, he filmed the changing light and wind perturbations affecting leaves and swamp waters. The film juxtaposes these two moments, celebrating recurring acts of listening and intimacy with the surroundings.
