The film brings together two moments in the daily life of the film maker, occurred in the same year. The first is filmed in Sansepolcro (IT), during a residency focused on learning the practice of flag waving. Back then Santalucia received a yellow flag for training purposes, and went in the surrounding forests to rehearse, filming his presence in the landscape. Once back in Rotterdam, engaging in sound walks to discover the urban landscape, he filmed the light changes occurring on the yellow trees. The film juxtapose these two moments, celebrating recurring actions of listening and intimacy with the surroundings.</div>
