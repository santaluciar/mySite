Riccardo Santalucia (IT/NL) works across electro-acoustic composition, live performing, interactive design and filmmaking. Collaging digital ecosystems into fictional worlds and stories, he patches together chimeras to explore human emotions. Rooted in video-game culture, fantasy and sci-fi literature, he is interested in devising alternative understandings of what identities, roles, relations and rules can be. Creating a space for surprise, on the backdrop of a critical stance to techno-capitalism, he is exploring how sound and images can evoke a certain sense of kindness and cultivate ethics of care.
